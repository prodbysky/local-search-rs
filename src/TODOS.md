TODO: 
 - Reindex on directory update
 - Flesh out the settings menu
 - Animations?
 - Optimization (when it becomes an issue)
 - Setup links to applications for different file types to open on click
 - More keybinds
 - On indexing/refreshing the model do some sort of multithreading so the UI does not hang and also we can report indexing progress
